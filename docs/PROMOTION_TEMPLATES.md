**Title: Show HN: Visual Agentic Dev – Click any React component to edit code with AI (Open Source)**

**Body:**

Hey everyone! 👋

I've been working on a tool to bridge the gap between browsing your local React app and editing code. It's called **Visual Agentic Dev**.

**The Problem:**
I found myself constantly switching between the browser (to see changes) and VS Code (to make changes), often losing context or spending time hunting for the right file/component.

**The Solution:**
Visual Agentic Dev allows you to:
1.  **Click** on any element in your local running React app.
2.  **Describe** what you want to change in a sidebar chat.
3.  **Watch** as an AI Agent (like Claude Code) modifies your local source code in real-time.

**Key Features:**
*   🎯 **Zero-Config Source Location**: Uses React Fiber magic to find files at runtime. No invasive Babel plugins required.
*   ⚡ **Instant Agent Readiness**: Innovative `AgentRegistry` architecture keeps the AI CLI hot and ready. Context switches are instant—no waiting for the agent to boot up.
*   🤖 **Dynamic Agent Support**: Plug-and-play with Claude Code, CCR, or any future terminal-based agent.
*   💻 **Immersive Terminal**: A full PTY terminal embedded in your browser using `xterm.js` and `node-pty`.
*   📂 **Smart Project Switching**: Automatically detects which project you're browsing (great for monorepos) and switches the agent's context instantly.

It's open source and I'd love your feedback!

**Subject: Stop hunting for React components. Just click and code.**

I just open-sourced **Visual Agentic Dev**, a new tool that brings the IDE into your browser.

It lets you click on any element in your local React server, and immediately instruct an AI agent (like Claude Code) to refactor, style, or fix it—writing directly to your local files.

It uses a bridge server and React Fiber internals to map DOM elements back to source code without complex build configs.
